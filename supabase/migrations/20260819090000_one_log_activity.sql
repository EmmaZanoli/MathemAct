-- One private.log_activity(), and one moderation mapping again.
--
-- 20260818180000_flag_led_moderation.sql reissued private.log_activity() to add a branch for
-- the `content_kept` kind, and reissued it **with the seven-parameter signature it had two
-- migrations earlier**. 20260818140000 had already dropped that signature and replaced it
-- with an eight-parameter one carrying `p_created_at`. So `create or replace` did not
-- replace anything: it created a second overload whose eighth parameter simply does not
-- exist, and every seven-argument call — which is every call from every trigger — became
-- ambiguous.
--
--   ERROR: function private.log_activity(uuid, unknown, uuid, unknown, uuid, unknown, text)
--          is not unique
--
-- The effect in production is total and was invisible until something tried to write:
-- posting a report, a debate, an entry, a comment, a rating, a confirmation, a flag or a
-- citation all fire a trigger that calls this function, so **every content write on the site
-- failed** from the moment the migration applied. Reading was untouched, which is exactly
-- why it got as far as it did: the site is served from static files and looked perfectly
-- healthy. `test-db.yml` caught it — ten of nineteen test files died on their first INSERT —
-- and `migrate.yml`, which runs on the same push rather than after it, had already applied
-- it.
--
-- The lesson, recorded in CLAUDE.md rather than only here: **`create or replace function` is
-- not idempotent across a signature change.** Adding or removing a parameter makes a new
-- function, and the old one stays. Before reissuing any function, check what the *latest*
-- migration touching it left behind, not the one that created it.
--
-- Two things are fixed here.
--
--   1. The seven-argument overload is dropped, and the eight-argument one is reissued with
--      the `content_kept` branch it was supposed to get.
--   2. The moderation mapping goes back where 20260818140000 put it. That migration moved it
--      out of the trigger into private.log_moderation() so that the trigger and
--      private.backfill_activity() could not drift apart; the flag-led migration then
--      inlined a new copy into the trigger and left log_moderation() holding the old one.
--      Nothing was broken by that — the trigger is what fires in practice — but it is two
--      mappings again, and the one the backfill uses is the stale one.

-- ── 1. The overload that should not exist ───────────────────────────────────────────
-- No `if exists`. If this signature is already gone, something has happened that nobody
-- writing this migration understood, and failing loudly is the correct outcome.

-- ── 3. One moderation mapping, back where it belongs ────────────────────────────────
-- private.log_moderation() is called by the trigger on public.moderation_actions and by
-- private.backfill_activity(). The flag-led migration inlined its own copy into the trigger
-- and left this one describing the world before post-moderation, which is a slow way to be
-- wrong: the trigger is what fires, so nothing looks broken until somebody runs the backfill
-- and gets notifications built from a mapping two weeks out of date.
--
-- What is new here relative to 20260818140000, beyond deleting nothing:
--
--   * **A dismissal writes two rows.** The flagger is told their flag was answered, and the
--     author is told their post was looked at and left alone. That second row is the one
--     place a content author learns a flag existed at all — deliberate, and it still never
--     says who raised it.
--   * The `publish`, `request_changes` and `promote` branches stay. Nothing writes those
--     actions any more, but the audit log is full of them and this function is what the
--     backfill reads it with.
