-- Schema version 2 of a report: the reporting standard grows the fields it was missing.
--
-- What this is for. The corpus exists so that a journal could adopt its shape as a tool
-- disclosure template, and the twelve-section form was thin in three places that anybody
-- doing secondary analysis keeps needing: **who** was working (career stage), **what the
-- prompts actually said**, and **how well it went, as numbers rather than adjectives**. It
-- also mixed two axes -- `programming` and formal verification were being written into the
-- narrative, because Area is "why you were working" and Task type is "what the tool was
-- asked to do", and neither had a home for them.
--
-- Fifteen sections now, and everything after the narrative is optional. That is the burden
-- budget doing its job: a forced number is noise in a dataset that will be read as evidence,
-- so every rating is skippable and a blank is more useful than a guess.
--
-- The five decisions in here worth reading before changing any of it
-- -----------------------------------------------------------------
--
--   1. **The example reports are deleted, not migrated.** They were written by the
--      moderators to see the pages render. Backfilling `schema_version = 1` onto them would
--      leave rows in the corpus that answer none of the new questions and that nobody can
--      complete, because the freeze rule fixes a report's text the moment somebody else
--      answers it. An empty corpus is the honest state of this project today.
--
--   2. **The enums are extended, not converted to text with a CHECK.** The
--      reporting-standard argument in 20260815100100 still holds: `alter type ... add value`
--      is a migration with a comment saying why, which is the correct amount of friction for
--      a decision that changes what every past account means. The *new* vocabularies that
--      have no enum yet -- career stage, generalisation, reference kind -- are text with a
--      CHECK, because each is a small closed list nothing joins against, and one of them is
--      read out of jsonb where an enum would buy nothing.
--
--   3. **`task_secondary` is an array of the same enum**, not a second vocabulary. A report
--      grouped under "proof drafting" and a report that also did proof drafting have to be
--      the same filter, and two spellings of one word is how that stops being true.
--
--   4. **`"references"` is quoted, because REFERENCES is a reserved word.** Every other
--      name in this schema is the JSON key and the CSV header unchanged, and an unquoted
--      identifier here would have cost a third name for one field. `select "references"` in
--      psql is a known annoyance; `supporting_material` in the database and `references` in
--      the export would be a permanent tax on every reader of the dataset.
--
--   5. **The third-party confirmation becomes conditional**, required when there is pasted
--      material and not otherwise. It was unconditional, which read as the stronger rule and
--      is the weaker one: a tick every submission needs carries no information and teaches
--      people to tick it without re-reading the excerpt. Now it is asked exactly when there
--      is something to have removed something from -- a transcript, or, new here, prompts,
--      which quote other people's material just as readily.
--
-- Nothing about moderation changes. `status` is still `published` / `hidden`, still moved
-- only by public.moderate(), and the spec's `draft` / `submitted` / `rejected` states are
-- deliberately not created: pre-moderation went on 2026-08-19, and a draft lives in
-- localStorage rather than in a table somebody has to moderate.

-- ── 1. Empty the corpus ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
-- In dependency order, because the polymorphic tables have no foreign key to reports and
-- would be left pointing at nothing. Written as unconditional deletes rather than against a
-- list of ids: this migration also runs against a fresh test database, where it is a no-op,
-- and against a branch where somebody has been submitting.
--
-- Two tables are deliberately untouched:
--
--   `public.moderation_actions` is append-only and its trigger fires for the owner too, so a
--   delete here would abort the migration. That is correct rather than inconvenient -- an
--   audit row records a decision somebody took, and it stays true after the thing it was
--   about has gone. `public.moderation_notices` stays for the same reason and can: it
--   carries a snapshot `label`, so it still reads as prose without its subject.

delete from public.citations
 where (source_type = 'report' and source_id in (select id from public.reports))
    or (target_type = 'report' and target_id in (select id from public.reports))

-- ── 2. The two axes, straightened ───────────────────────────────────────────────────
--
-- Area is *why you were working*. `outreach` and `administration` are the two kinds of
-- mathematical work the original five did not cover, and both are places where these tools
-- are used heavily and reported on never: a grant application is not research and is not
-- writing, and explaining a theorem to a school class is not teaching a course.
--
-- Task type is *what the tool was asked to do*. `comprehension` is among the commonest uses
-- there is and had nowhere to go -- "I read a paper with it" was landing in
-- `literature_search`, which is a different question. `programming` is code that is not a
-- formal proof, which `formalisation` was quietly absorbing, and that makes the
-- formalisation numbers wrong in the direction of overstating them.
--
-- `alter type ... add value` inside a transaction is fine on Postgres 12 and later provided
-- the new label is not *used* before the commit. Nothing below uses one.

-- Both positioned `before 'other'` rather than one after the other. Postgres will not let a
-- label added in this transaction be *used* before it commits, and `after 'outreach'` on the
-- second statement would be leaning on the first -- so both name only labels that were
-- already there. The resulting sort order is cosmetic in any case: display order comes from
-- AREAS in src/lib/report-schema.ts, and nothing orders by this column.
alter type public.report_area add value if not exists 'outreach'       before 'other';
alter type public.report_area add value if not exists 'administration' before 'other';

alter type public.report_task_type
  add value if not exists 'comprehension' after 'literature_search';
alter type public.report_task_type
  add value if not exists 'programming' after 'computation';

comment on type public.report_area is
  'Why the work was being done. Distinct from report_task_type, which is what the tool was '
  'asked to do: mixing the two makes both axes useless for grouping.';
comment on type public.report_task_type is
  'What the tool was asked to do. The primary axis for grouping the corpus, and also the '
  'vocabulary of reports.task_secondary.';

-- ── 3. The new columns ──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

alter table public.reports
  -- Bumped whenever a field or a vocabulary changes, so an analysis five years from now can
  -- tell a row that answered a question from a row that was never asked it. There is no
  -- INSERT or UPDATE grant for it in either direction and the guard trigger freezes it: it
  -- is the schema's statement about the row, not the author's.
  add column schema_version smallint not null default 2,

  -- Section 2. Required exactly when the area is `other`, which is the only way "other"
  -- means anything: an unqualified `other` is a row that has opted out of the axis.
  add column area_other text,

  -- Section 3. Anything else the tool was asked to do in the same session. The primary is
  -- what the corpus groups by; this is what stops a session that drafted *and* checked a
  -- proof from having to pick one and lose the other.
  add column task_secondary public.report_task_type[] not null default '{}',

  -- Section 5. Coarse on purpose, and optional on purpose. Reports are permanent and under
  -- CC BY: career stage plus subject area plus a date is already close to identifying in a
  -- small field, which is why institution, country and year of birth are not here and must
  -- not be added. There is no `prefer_not_to_say` value -- the column is nullable, so a null
  -- already says that, and offering both makes the blank state ambiguous.
  add column career_stage text,

  -- Section 10. The part of the record with instructional value: a prompt is short,
  -- reusable, and is what a reader copies. Kept apart from the transcript because a
  -- transcript is evidence nobody reads except to check a claim, and one box for both buries
  -- the prompt where it can be neither indexed nor shown in a listing.
  add column prompts text,

  -- Section 13. Links only, and the quoting is explained in the header. jsonb rather than a
  -- child table: unlike a tool, a reference has no date to go stale, nothing joins to it,
  -- and nothing filters on more than "is there one of kind X".
  add column "references" jsonb not null default '[]'::jsonb,

  -- Section 14. Five scales, two of them shown conditionally, all null when unanswered.
  -- Never 0 for "not asked": a hidden scale submitting 0 would write "no help at all" into
  -- the corpus for every teaching-prep session that was never asked about novelty.
  add column rating_helpfulness           smallint,
  add column rating_time_saved            smallint,
  add column rating_trust_before_checking smallint,
  add column rating_verification_effort   smallint,
  add column rating_novelty               smallint,
  add column rating_understanding_gained  smallint,

  -- The one fact a 0-to-10 scale cannot hold. Without it, "the tool wasted my afternoon" and
  -- "the tool was mildly disappointing" both score 0 on time saved, and the first is one of
  -- the most useful things this corpus can record.
  add column cost_more_time_than_saved boolean not null default false,

  -- Not a scale, deliberately. How far the author thinks this carries is a guess, and three
  -- named answers say so where an 11-point number would pretend to a precision nobody has.
  add column generalises text;

-- Two derived booleans, and they exist for one caller: the freshness overlay in
-- src/lib/fresh.ts, which has to decide whether a report posted since the last export matches
-- the "includes the prompts" and "includes a transcript" filters.
--
-- Without them that decision costs the text. A transcript excerpt is capped at twenty thousand
-- characters and the overlay fetches two dozen rows, so answering a yes-or-no question would
-- mean pulling half a megabyte onto a listing page -- on the one query in this project that is
-- allowed to touch the database from a reading page, and only because it is small. The
-- alternative is a fresh card that quietly fails a filter it should match, which is precisely
-- the class of bug the overlay's rules exist to prevent.
--
-- STORED because Postgres has no other kind, and generated rather than trigger-maintained
-- because a copy kept in step by a trigger is a copy that can be out of step. Nothing may
-- write these: a generated column has no INSERT or UPDATE grant to give, which is also why
-- the guard trigger does not name them.
--
-- **A separate statement, on purpose.** `has_prompts` reads `prompts`, which the ALTER TABLE
-- above adds, and a generation expression that resolves a column added by its own statement is
-- asking Postgres a question it is under no obligation to answer. Two statements cost nothing
-- and remove the question.

alter table public.reports
  add column has_prompts boolean
    generated always as (prompts is not null) stored,
  add column has_transcript boolean
    generated always as (transcript_excerpt is not null) stored;

        else area_other is null
      end
    ),

  -- Three, matching the form. Deduplication and stripping the primary are done by the
  -- normalising trigger below rather than refused here: a duplicated secondary task is a

           or generalises in ('task_specific', 'similar_tasks', 'broadly'));

-- ── 5. The third-party confirmation becomes conditional ─────────────────────────────
-- See decision 5 in the header. The rule is now "affirm it when you have pasted something",
-- and `prompts` counts as having pasted something: a prompt quoting a colleague's
-- unpublished conjecture is the same disclosure as a transcript quoting it.
--
-- Note which direction this moves in. Before, a report with a transcript could not exist
-- without the tick and neither could a report with nothing pasted at all. The first is
-- unchanged; the second is now allowed, and the tick means something when it is there.

comment on column public.reports.third_party_material_confirmed is

  'never contains a duplicate: private.normalise_report_tasks() sees to both.';
comment on column public.reports.career_stage is
  'Coarse and optional. Institution, country and date of birth are deliberately not '
  'collected: a report is permanent and under CC BY, and this field plus a subject area is '
  'already close to identifying in a small field.';
comment on column public.reports.prompts is
  'The prompts, verbatim, including the ones that had to be rewritten. Rendered escaped and '
  'monospace, never as Markdown or TeX: the point of the field is that it is not prose.';
comment on column public.reports."references" is
  'Supporting links: [{"kind": "...", "url": "https://...", "label": "..."}]. Quoted because '
  'REFERENCES is reserved; the name is kept so the JSON key and the CSV header do not need a '
  'third spelling. Validated by private.check_report_references().';
comment on column public.reports.cost_more_time_than_saved is
  'The fact a 0-10 scale cannot express. Without it, a wasted afternoon and a mild '
  'disappointment both score 0 on rating_time_saved.';
comment on column public.reports.rating_novelty is
  'Null when the question was not asked, which is most of the corpus: it is shown only when '
  'the area or a task type makes novelty a meaningful question. Never 0 for "not asked".';
comment on column public.reports.rating_understanding_gained is
  'Null when the question was not asked. See rating_novelty.';
comment on column public.reports.has_prompts is

-- ── 12. submit_report and resubmit_report ───────────────────────────────────────────
--
-- **Dropped and recreated, not replaced.** `create or replace function` is not idempotent
-- across a signature change: adding a parameter creates a *second* function, the old one
-- stays, and every call that fits both becomes "function ... is not unique". That is not
-- hypothetical here -- it is exactly how 20260819090000 came to exist, after two
-- private.log_activity()s stopped every content write on the site while reading looked
-- perfectly healthy because reading is static.
--
-- Every new parameter is appended after `p_tag_codes` and defaulted, so a positional call
-- written against the old signature still resolves. The ratings are `integer` rather than
-- `smallint` for the reason the original migration gives: Postgres will not implicitly
-- narrow an integer literal to smallint while resolving which function to call, so a
-- smallint parameter turns `submit_report(..., 8, ...)` into "function does not exist" --
-- a message that sends you looking for a missing migration rather than a missing cast.
--
-- `p_task_secondary` is `text[]` and cast inside, for the same reason: `array['exposition']`
-- is text[], and a `report_task_type[]` parameter would make every positional call fail
-- resolution rather than fail a cast.
