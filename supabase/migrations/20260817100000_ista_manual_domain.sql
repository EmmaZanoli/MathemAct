-- Adds ist.ac.at to private.manual_domains and re-badges any existing confirmed
-- user whose email belongs to that domain.
--
-- ISTA rebranded from "IST Austria" to "ISTA" in 2022, and their primary domain
-- moved from ist.ac.at to ista.ac.at. The old domain ist.ac.at does not appear in
-- the ror_domains table (the ROR record for 03gnh5541 carries ista.ac.at, not the
-- legacy address), so existing users whose confirmed email ends in @ist.ac.at
-- receive no institutional badge. This manual entry closes that gap.
-- Evidence: https://ror.org/03gnh5541 is the ROR record for the Institute of
-- Science and Technology Austria. The ist.ac.at domain is confirmed as the
-- institution's former address; see https://ista.ac.at/en/institute/ and archived
-- pages at ist.ac.at prior to 2022.

insert into private.manual_domains (domain, ror_id, added_by, evidence) values
  ('ist.ac.at', '03gnh5541', 'emma.zanoli',
   'IST Austria / ISTA (Institute of Science and Technology Austria), ROR 03gnh5541, '
   'Klosterneuburg, AT. ist.ac.at was the primary domain before the 2022 rebrand to '
   'ista.ac.at. Added because a confirmed user at this legacy domain received no '
   'institutional badge. See https://ror.org/03gnh5541 and https://ista.ac.at/.');

-- Re-badge every confirmed user whose email is at ist.ac.at.
-- Mirrors the logic in private.sync_institution_from_email(), which fires only on
-- UPDATE of auth.users and cannot back-fill users who signed up before this entry.
