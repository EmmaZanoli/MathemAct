-- Reconstructing the activity feed from history, and doing it exactly once.
--
-- The backfill exists because triggers observe statements and nothing was watching before
-- 20260818120100. Everything that matters about it is in two properties:
--
--   **It uses the real dates.** A feed stamped with the date of the migration would be a
--   lie in the one column people read as history. Every source table carries created_at and
--   public.moderation_actions is a complete dated log, so the reconstruction is exact.
--
--   **It cannot write a row twice.** It has to be safe over rows the triggers already saw,
--   because the migration lands after the triggers have been live for a while, and safe to
--   run again by hand. The guard is the timestamp: a trigger fires in the same transaction
--   as the row that fired it, so the activity row's now() and the source row's created_at
--   are the same value, not merely close. That is what separates the pairs that would
--   otherwise collide — two people rating one debate, several comments on one report.
--
-- The setup below turns the triggers off, writes history underneath them, and turns them
-- back on. That is what the production database looked like on the morning this ran.
