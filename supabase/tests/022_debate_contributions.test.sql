-- Debate contributions: the position they were written from, flatness, endorsement, the edit
-- window, supersession, and the rating history.
--
-- **Every rule under test is conditional on the subject being a debate, and half of these
-- assertions exist to prove that the other half did not leak into report threads.** The two
-- content types share public.comments, and a report thread is the one place on this site where
-- nesting is correct. So for each new rule there is a matching assertion that a report comment
-- still behaves as it did: a reply still succeeds, a report comment is still editable while an
-- endorsement exists on a debate contribution elsewhere, and the score column is NULL on it.
--
-- Three of these would pass against a broken implementation if they were written the obvious
-- way, and are written the way they are for that reason:
--
--   The score column is asserted after the author's rating has changed, not only before.
--   Copying the rating at insert and joining it live are indistinguishable until somebody
--   changes their mind, which is the entire reason the column exists.
--
--   The edit window on an endorsed contribution is asserted from the author's side, and the
--   endorsement is made by somebody else. public.comment_endorsements is readable only by the
--   endorser, so an implementation that inlined the existence check in the SECURITY INVOKER
--   guard would see zero endorsements, allow the edit, and look correct in review.
--
--   The score column is asserted to be overwritten with the grant deliberately widened. The
--   protection that matters is the trigger, not the absent grant, and a test that only proves
--   the door is locked says nothing about the floor under it.
--
-- On flatness there are two assertions rather than one, because the rule is written twice on
-- purpose and the two halves fail differently. The constraint is asserted as the table owner,
-- who is not subject to row level security, so what refuses the row is unambiguously the CHECK.
-- The policy's copy of the condition is asserted against the catalogue. Written as a single
-- insert by a browser, the test would be asserting an error code that depends on whether
-- Postgres evaluates a permissive WITH CHECK before or after a table constraint — which is an
-- implementation detail of the server, not a fact about this schema.
--
-- Fixtures are created as the table owner, which the guards trust. Every behavioural assertion
-- runs under `set local role`, because what is being tested is what a browser can do. Note that
-- `id` is absent from the INSERT column grant on public.comments, so nothing inserted as
-- `authenticated` may name it; those rows are found again by their body.
--
-- No savepoints are taken, so there is no deferred-constraint mode to put back.
