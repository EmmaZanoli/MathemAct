-- Banning an account: the effect, the sentence it sends, and what it refuses.
--
-- 016_moderation.test.sql already proves the effect — a moderator bans a member, not a
-- moderator, not themselves, and the flag flips on a column with no grant behind it. This
-- file is about the three things that were missing around it, each of which made the feature
-- present in the schema and absent in practice:
--
--   **The banned account is told, in writing.** A ban is the harshest thing a moderator can
--   do here, it is the one decision that reaches somebody with no post attached to it, and
--   until 20260819120000 the explanation the function *insists* on went to the audit log and
--   stopped. Every assertion about public.moderation_notices below is really an assertion
--   about that: the reason exists, the person it is about can read it, and nobody else can.
--
--   **It can be lifted, and lifting it says so too.** An unban is its own decision with its
--   own sentence, not the absence of a ban.
--
--   **It cannot be repeated.** The effect of banning twice is nothing; the *notification* of
--   banning twice is a second message telling somebody something that did not happen. The
--   refusal is what keeps a feed honest.
--
-- The last section is the point of the whole feature and belongs in a test rather than in a
-- runbook: a banned account cannot write. Every content table is asserted from the banned
-- side, because "a ban means a ban" appears in **nine** insert policies and one of them being
-- wrong would look exactly like a member having a bad day.
--
-- The count has now been wrong twice, in opposite directions, which is the argument for
-- asserting each policy by hand rather than trusting any list of them. The first version of
-- this file and the runbook beside it both said seven and both forgot public.citations, making
-- it eight. 20260821120200 added public.comment_endorsements, making it nine. Every place that
-- states the number — this header, docs/moderation.md, the README and CLAUDE.md — has been
-- wrong about it at some point, and none of them is load-bearing: the assertions below are.
