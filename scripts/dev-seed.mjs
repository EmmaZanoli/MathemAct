/**
 * Fill data/ with fixture content, for looking at a populated debates section locally.
 *
 *   node scripts/dev-seed.mjs          # write the fixtures
 *   git checkout -- 'data/*.json'      # put the real export back
 *
 * ── Read this before running it ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * **`data/` is the published corpus.** It is committed, it is the citable CC BY dataset, and
 * `data/README.md` tells people to cite it by the `exportedAt` in the manifest. The files this
 * script writes are invented — invented claims, invented positions, invented people — so
 * committing them would publish fabricated research conduct under a licence that invites reuse.
 *
 * Nothing here is destructive: `data/*.json` is tracked, so everything this overwrites is one
 * `git checkout` away. But it will show up as a diff, and it must not be committed. Every
 * fixture profile is marked `isPseudonym` and every fixture id starts `dddd`/`eeee`/`ffff` so a
 * row from this script is recognisable at a glance.
 *
 * ── What this can and cannot show you ───────────────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * Seedable, because it is read from `data/` at build time:
 *
 *   /debates/            the sparkline on each card, the statistics line, all five orderings,
 *                        the area and subject-area filters, the empty and ineligible states
 *   /debates/<id>/       the whole contributions section — twelve position groups, both views,
 *                        sorting, the movement badge on a superseded contribution, endorsement
 *                        counts, a soft-deleted contribution, the off-scale group
 *
 * **Not seedable: the histogram on a debate page.** That is a live query against
 * `public.debate_ratings`, deliberately — the distribution is withheld until the reader has
 * answered, so it is fetched rather than built into the page, or hiding it would be a decoration
 * that view-source defeats. No amount of static data will populate it, and the endorsement
 * buttons and the writing box are gated behind the same fetch because they need to know the
 * reader has answered.
 *
 * To see those, the database needs this branch's migrations:
 *
 *   supabase link --project-ref fgnmafmzracdytpfqpel && supabase db push
 *
 * ── The numbers ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * Every aggregate below is **computed from its histogram** by the same formulas
 * scripts/export.mjs uses, rather than typed in beside it. A fixture whose median disagreed
 * with its own bars would make the page look broken in a way the page was not.
