/**
 * Export the public corpus to data/, as JSON the site builds from and CSV people can cite.
 *
 *   node scripts/export.mjs [--out data] [--dry-run] [--allow-shrink]
 *
 * This script is the read path. CLAUDE.md's read/write split is what makes a free tier
 * viable in production: the site is built from these files, so a traffic spike never touches
 * the egress quota, reading still works while the database is paused or over quota, and this
 * job's own activity is what stops the project being paused for inactivity in the first
 * place. Nothing a reader does opens a connection to Supabase.
 *
 * ── The rule that matters most ──────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * **This connects with a role that bypasses row level security, so the WHERE clauses below
 * are the entire boundary between public and private.** Everywhere else in this project the
 * policies do that work and a mistake is caught by them. Not here. Every query states its own
 * public filter explicitly, even where a filter looks redundant, and each one is written next
 * to the reason it exists. If you add a query, write its filter first.
 *
 * What is excluded, and why each would be a real leak:
 *
 *   auth.users            addresses. Never read, by anything, ever. There is no join to it
 *                         anywhere below and there must never be one.
 *   pending, hidden       content nobody has approved, and content a moderator removed. The
 *                         second is worse: an export would republish exactly what was hidden.
 *   deleted               soft-deleted reports and the bodies of deleted comments.
 *   public.flags        who complained about whom.
 *   moderation_actions    the audit log, including the reasons moderators wrote each other.
 *   deletion_requests     who is leaving.
 *   public.ratings        individual answers. A rating row is readable only by its author,
 *                         and the aggregate is the *only* form any of it may take. One
 *                         attributable row would undo the promise the whole scale rests on.
 *   profiles.role         who the moderators are.
 *   profiles.is_banned    a public list of banned accounts is a punishment nobody agreed to.
 *   institution_source    which of the three domain layers issued a badge. Never displayed;
 *                         the surest way to keep that true is for it never to leave the
 *                         database.
 *   has_prompts,          two generated booleans that exist so the freshness overlay can
 *   has_transcript        answer a filter without fetching a transcript. Not a leak, just
 *                         redundant here: this file carries the text itself.
 *
 * ── Why a direct connection and not the service role key ────────────────────────────
 *
 * The prompt for this work names both SUPABASE_DB_URL and the service role key. Only the
 * first is used, and the second is deliberately not passed to this job.
 *
 * They authorise the same thing — a read that bypasses row level security — but through
 * different doors. Over PostgREST the service role key would need paginating past a default
 * 1000-row limit, cannot express the lateral aggregates below, and would take one request per
 * dataset per page. A direct connection is one round trip per dataset, is the same path
 * `supabase db push` already uses from CI, and is the same `pg_dump`-shaped exit this project
 * chose Supabase for. Handing a job a credential it does not need is how credentials end up
 * in logs.
 *
 * ── Shapes ──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * The JSON is camelCase because the site consumes it directly: each file deserialises into
 * the interface of the same name in src/lib/. **When one of those interfaces changes, the
 * mapping below changes with it**, and there is no type checker spanning the two — this
 * script is plain Node and the site is TypeScript. The CSV is snake_case because it mirrors
 * the column names in supabase/migrations/, which is what a researcher reading the schema
 * will have in front of them.

Export the public corpus to JSON and CSV.

  node scripts/export.mjs [options]

Options
  --out <dir>      Where to write. Default: data
  --dry-run        Query and report; write nothing.
  --allow-shrink   Permit an export in which any JSON file drops more than half the rows
                   it had in the previous manifest. Refused otherwise, because the usual
                   cause is a broken query rather than a mass deletion.

Environment
  SUPABASE_DB_URL  Connection string. Direct connection, not PostgREST.

    $env:SUPABASE_DB_URL = "postgresql://..."      # PowerShell
    export SUPABASE_DB_URL="postgresql://..."      # bash

  In CI it is a repository secret and is used by .github/workflows/export.yml and by
  migrate.yml, and by nothing else.

 * a mild version of agreeing or disagreeing, and folding it in would move a debate toward the
 * middle for a reason that has nothing to do with where anybody stands.
 *
 * `divided` is twice the smaller of the two sides' shares. Twice, so that a clean 50/50 split
 * scores 1 rather than 0.5 and the number reads as a proportion of the most divided a debate
 * could be. Taking the *smaller* side is what makes it a measure of contest rather than of
 * volume: 90 against 10 scores 0.2, and 10 against 90 also scores 0.2, because they are the
 * same shape seen from two directions. **The neutral 5s are deliberately in neither side.**
 * They are counted in the denominator and in no numerator, so a debate where everybody sits at
 * 5 comes out as 0 divided — which is correct, and is a thing a mean of 5.0 could not tell you
 * apart from a clean two-camp split.
 *
 * `consensus` is the largest share held by any one of the five families. Families rather than
 * single scores because 8 and 7 are not a disagreement, and a metric that treated them as one
 * would report a united community as fractured over rounding.
 *
 * Returns nulls below the threshold rather than zeros. A zero is a real reading — "nobody
 * disagrees" — and a debate with four answers has not established that.
