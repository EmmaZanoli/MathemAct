# Contributing to MathemAct

MathemAct is a small project maintained by one person with volunteer moderators. Most
contributions happen through the site itself — submitting a practice, rating a proposition,
suggesting a resource — and that is the most valuable thing anyone can do.

This file is for people who want to contribute to the code or the database schema.

## Before you start

Read [CLAUDE.md](CLAUDE.md). It contains the constraints that every decision is built
around — zero budget, static hosting, no secrets in the client, no Google Fonts CDN,
logic in Postgres, and more. A contribution that violates a hard constraint will not be
merged regardless of how well it is written.

## Getting set up locally

```sh
git clone https://github.com/EmmaZanoli/MathemAct
cd MathemAct
npm install
cp .env.example .env          # fill in SUPABASE_URL and SUPABASE_ANON_KEY
npm run dev                   # Astro dev server at http://localhost:4321
```

The site builds from `data/`, which is committed. A fresh clone builds immediately
without a database connection. You will need Supabase credentials only if you are working
on a feature that writes to the database.

## Database

**Never edit a migration that has already been applied.** Migrations are append-only.
If you need to change something, add a new migration in `supabase/migrations/` with the
next timestamp in the filename.

Every migration file starts with a comment saying what it does and why.

Database tests live in `supabase/tests/`. They run in CI on every branch. There is no
container runtime on the development machine, so `supabase start` cannot run locally —
the test run in CI is the one that matters.

```sh
# Apply a migration (requires supabase CLI and project link):
supabase login
supabase link --project-ref <ref>
supabase db push
```

See `docs/decisions.md` for the reasoning behind non-obvious choices.

## Opening a pull request

1. Branch from `main`.
2. Make one coherent change per branch. A PR that adds a feature and refactors unrelated
   code is harder to review.
3. Run `npm run build` before pushing. Fix any TypeScript errors or warnings.
4. If your change touches the database schema, update `supabase/tests/` and verify the
   tests pass in CI before asking for review.
5. Update `docs/decisions.md` if you made a non-obvious choice.

## Moderation

The moderation queue is at `/moderate/`. There is no navigation link to it — it is
documented in `docs/moderation.md`, which is where new moderators are pointed.

## Reporting a bug

Open a GitHub issue. Include enough to reproduce it: what you did, what you expected,
what happened instead. A screenshot helps.
