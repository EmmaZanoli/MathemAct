/**
 * The twelve groups a contribution can be read under, and the one function that decides which.
 *
 * Eleven positions on the scale, gathered into five families, plus a twelfth group **outside
 * the scale entirely** for the people who answered "no opinion, or outside my expertise".
 *
 * Why the twelfth group is not a rounding error
 * ---------------------------------------------
 * It would be easy to drop, because it does not fit the shape of the other eleven: it has no
 * number, it sorts nowhere, and it belongs to no family. Dropping it would remove exactly the
 * contributions this audience most respects. On a claim about Lean formalisation, "I cannot
 * judge the formalisation cost, and that is the whole of the disagreement" is frequently the
 * most honest thing on the page, and the person who wrote it is not a neutral 5 — they are off
 * the axis. A design that quietly filed them at the neutral end would be asserting a position
 * they explicitly declined to take.
 *
 * So it is a group of its own, after the five families rather than inside them, labelled in
 * words rather than with a number.
 *
 * **This module must not import anything that reaches src/lib/supabase.ts.** It is imported by
 * a component's client script. It imports nothing.

 * "this person was asked and declined" — and an older file is no evidence for it. They cannot
 * be dropped either. So they get a group that says what is actually true, and it is rendered
