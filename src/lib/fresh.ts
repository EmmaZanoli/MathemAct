/**
 * The freshness overlay: what has been posted since the site was last built.
 *
 * The corpus is served as static files exported nightly, which means a report posted this
 * morning is invisible until tomorrow. For most of this site that is the right trade — it is
 * what keeps a free tier viable — but for somebody who has just posted, and for anybody
 * arriving from a link they were sent, a day-long silence looks like the submission was
 * lost. So each listing hydrates from the static page and then asks one question: is there
 * anything newer than the export?
 *
 * Four rules, and each is the difference between an overlay and a liability.
 *
 * **Plain fetch, never the Supabase client.** A listing is a reading page. Importing
 * src/lib/supabase.ts would pull the auth client, its storage adapter and its session
 * machinery into a page whose job is to be read, and CLAUDE.md forbids exactly that. This is
 * one GET against PostgREST with the publishable key, which is public by design.
 *
 * **Capped.** At most two dozen rows, and never a second page. This is a nudge toward the
 * newest handful, not a substitute for the export: if a hundred reports arrive in a day,
 * the answer is the nightly build, not a listing that quietly turns into a live query.
 *
 * **Time-limited.** A few seconds, then abandoned. The static content is already on screen
 * and correct; a request that hangs must not delay anything or hold a connection open.
 *
 * **Silent on failure.** Every path returns an empty array. A paused project, a network
 * failure, an over-quota database, a deployment with no keys configured: all of them mean
 * the reader sees the corpus as it stood at the last build, which is the whole point of
 * building it into files. There is no error state here and there should not be one — an
 * error message about a database on a page that is already showing its content would teach
 * readers that this site depends on something it does not.
