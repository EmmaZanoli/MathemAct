/**
 * Base-aware URL building. Use this for every internal link and asset reference.
 *
 * Why this file exists
 * --------------------
 * The site is served from `https://emmazanoli.github.io/MathemAct/`, so internal URLs
 * carry a `/MathemAct` prefix. Astro exposes that prefix as `import.meta.env.BASE_URL`
 * but does not rewrite markup for you — a literal `href="/reports/"` resolves to
 * `emmazanoli.github.io/reports/`, outside our site, and 404s.
 *
 * Three reasons to funnel every path through here rather than writing them by hand:
 *
 *  1. The prefix is a deployment detail, not content. Moving to a custom domain should
 *     be a one-line change to `base` in astro.config.mjs, not a repo-wide find and
 *     replace across every template.
 *  2. `trailingSlash: 'always'` is configured, so a link missing its trailing slash is
 *     a 404 in `astro dev` and an extra redirect hop on GitHub Pages. Enforcing it in
 *     one function means it cannot be forgotten in a template.
 *  3. Hardcoded prefixes rot silently. `/MathemAct/MathemAct/...` is the classic
 *     symptom of someone half-remembering that a prefix is needed.
 *
 * Pass site-root-relative paths: `path('/reports/')`, not `path('../reports/')`.
 * Absolute URLs and `mailto:` links are returned untouched, so it is safe to call on a
 * href that might be either.
