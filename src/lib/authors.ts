/**
 * Who gets an author page, and where their name and badge come from.
 *
 * This is its own file rather than another function in practices.ts for a bundling reason.
 * `resources.ts` does a static `import` of data/resources.json, so anything that imports it
 * carries the resource corpus — and practices.ts is imported by browser scripts, the
 * submission form among them. Tree-shaking would probably drop it; probably is not a good
 * enough reason to put a build-time-only join into a module the browser loads.
 *
 * **Membership: anyone whose name is linked from something.** That is practice authors,
 * proposition authors, and resource submitters. Deliberately not everyone in
 * data/profiles.json, which also holds people whose only contribution is a comment — nothing
 * links a name from a comment, so a page for them would be one no reader can reach and
 * Pagefind would index it as an almost-empty result. The rule is that a page exists exactly
 * where a link to it exists. If comment authors ever become links, this function is the one
 * thing to change.
 *
 * **Identity: data/profiles.json, with the corpus as a fallback.** The three corpora do not
 * agree on how much they carry about a person. A practice and a resource each embed the
 * institution triple a badge is built from; a proposition embeds only the name and the
 * pseudonym flag. Taking identity from the corpus that happened to mention someone first
 * would therefore drop the institutional badge from the page of anyone who has only ever
 * posted a proposition — silently, and in the one direction that matters, since a badge that
 * fails to appear looks like an account that was never verified.
