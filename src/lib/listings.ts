/**
 * What each of the three corpus listings filters and sorts by.
 *
 * The dimensions and the sorts are defined once and read twice: the page's frontmatter uses
 * them at build time to render the filter rail and the sort <select>, and the same page's
 * client script hands them to `createListing()` in src/lib/listing-filters.ts. Splitting
 * that in two is how a sort option ends up in a menu with no comparator behind it, which
 * presents as a control that quietly does nothing.
 *
 * **This module must not import anything that reaches src/lib/supabase.ts**, for the reason
 * given at the top of listing-filters.ts. It imports nothing.
 *
 * Reports carries ten dimensions and the other two carry one each, which is not an
 * oversight: a report answers fifteen structured sections and a debate is a sentence with an
 * area on it. Offering a filter the data cannot support is worse than offering none, because
 * it reads as a corpus that is empty rather than as a question nobody asked.

/**
 * Area, and nothing else.
 *
 * A debate is a single sentence, an optional rationale and an area, so area is the whole of
 * what there is to filter on. **Nothing here filters on ratings**, and that is still the rule
 * even though cards now show a distribution: a filter is a claim that the corpus divides along
 * that axis, and "median above 7" invites reading a rough 0-to-10 self-report as a measurement.
 * An ordering is honest about being rough; a threshold is not.
 *
 * **Tags: there is no vocabulary for debates and this is the seam.** `public.debates` has no tag
 * table — `tags` and `report_tags` are the reports' — so a "Subject area" fieldset here would be
 * an empty rail with a zero beside every option, which reads as a corpus that is empty rather
 * than as a question nobody asked. When debates get tags, one entry here and one line in
 * `DebateCard.astro` is the whole change.

/**
 * The two aggregate sorts, and the line they sit on.
 *
 * This file previously said that nothing on the debates listing touches ratings, full stop.
 * **That has been narrowed rather than abandoned, and the distinction is the whole of why
 * these are sorts and not filters or figures.** An ordering says "these claims divide the
 * community" about the corpus. A number on a card says "this claim divides it 60/40" about one
 * debate, to a reader who has not answered — which is the thing the debate page withholds and
 * a listing must not hand over instead.
 *
 * **The second half of that stopped being true on 2026-08-22.** A card now carries a
 * distribution sparkline and `N positions · C contributions · K changed position`, because a
 * list of bare sentences gave a reader no way to choose what to read. See the header of
 * `DebateCard.astro` for the argument and for what survives of the old rule — chiefly that
 * positions lead, that the **mean** appears on no card and on no sort control, and that a card
 * the overlay added shows no distribution at all rather than a row of zeros.
 *
 * What is still true is the part these sorts depend on: **no ranking figure.** Nothing on a card
 * says where it came in, and neither `divided` nor `consensus` is printed anywhere.
 *
 * Both are export-time aggregates read off `data-divided` and `data-consensus`. A debate with
 * fewer than ten scored positions, and every debate the freshness overlay added, carries the
 * empty string in both — so `descending()` sorts it last under either, which is the engine's
 * existing behaviour for a card that cannot be ranked. See `shareValue()` in
 * src/lib/debate-facets.ts for why the empty string and not a zero.
 *
 * `popularity` keeps its comparator and loses its label. "Most popular" was a copy-rule
 * violation of long standing — the debates vocabulary forbids *popular* and *top* — and on a
 * page about disagreement it read as a ranking of claims by approval. "Most answered" says
 * what the comparator actually does: raters plus contributions, a measure of attention.
