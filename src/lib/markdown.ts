/**
 * Markdown with TeX, rendered to HTML at build time.
 *
 * Everything a contributor writes — the report narrative, comments, debate text —
 * goes through here. It is therefore a security boundary, and the ordering below is the
 * part worth understanding before changing anything.
 *
 * The pipeline
 * ------------
 *   parse markdown → GFM → find math → to HTML → SANITISE → render TeX → serialise
 *
 * Sanitising happens *before* KaTeX, not after, for two reasons:
 *
 *  1. KaTeX emits a large amount of markup — nested spans carrying dozens of layout
 *     classes, plus a parallel MathML tree. Sanitising afterwards would mean adding all
 *     of it to the allowlist, which in practice means allowing arbitrary spans and
 *     classes and giving up most of what the sanitiser was for.
 *  2. It is unnecessary. The sanitiser's job is the untrusted input; at the point KaTeX
 *     runs, all that survives of a formula is its TeX source as a text node. KaTeX
 *     escapes what it renders, and with `trust: false` it refuses the commands that
 *     could emit a URL or raw HTML.
 *
 * Two further defences, so this does not rest on one mechanism:
 *
 *  - `remark-rehype` is called without `allowDangerousHtml`, so raw HTML in the source
 *    is discarded at the mdast→hast boundary before the sanitiser ever sees it.
 *  - KaTeX runs with `trust: false` (its default, stated explicitly because it is
 *    load-bearing), which disables \href, \url, \includegraphics, and \htmlClass.
 *
 * If you add a plugin, add it on the correct side of the sanitise step and say why.

 * its own TeX source — a failure that looks like a KaTeX bug and is not one.

 * The nested-array form allowlists *specific values*: a span may carry `math-inline` and
