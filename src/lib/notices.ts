/**
 * Moderation decisions, as the people they are about read them.
 *
 * A moderator hides a comment, or looks at a flag and leaves the post where it was. Two
 * people are owed the reason: whoever wrote the post, and whoever raised the flag. Neither
 * of them may read public.moderation_actions — that log is written *to other moderators*,
 * in the shorthand of people who have read the whole queue, and it names the moderator. So
 * the same sentence is written twice: once into the log, and once into
 * public.moderation_notices, addressed to a person.
 *
 * This module reads the second one. It is browser-only, like src/lib/activity.ts and for the
 * same reason: a decision about your post is not in the static export and must never be.
 *
 * What a notice never carries, and what the policy behind it is doing:
 *
 *   * **No moderator's name.** The row has no column for one. A hide is the site's decision,
 *     not one person's, and naming the hand turns an appeal into a grievance.
 *   * **No flagger's name.** An author is told their post was flagged and decided. Who
 *     raised it is not part of the answer, and telling them is how a moderation system
 *     becomes a weapon.
 *   * **One row per recipient**, so the policy is `recipient_id = auth.uid()` and nothing
 *     more delicate than that. See the migration for why that shape was chosen.
 *
 * The feed at /account/activity/ says *that* something was decided. This says *why*. Both
 * exist because a notification nobody can act on is noise, and an explanation nobody is told
 * about is a file in a drawer.
