/**
 * Everything the site knows about reports: reading the corpus at build time, and the two
 * things a browser does to it.
 *
 * The swap point
 * --------------
 * `readCorpus()` below is the only function that knows where the corpus comes from. **It is
 * now the committed export in data/ and nothing else** — the PostgREST fallback that stood
 * here until the nightly job existed has gone, and its absence is the feature. While it was
 * there, a build with credentials silently produced a different site from a build without
 * them, and a paused database would have gone unnoticed until somebody wondered why the
 * corpus had stopped growing. Now a build reads files or reads nothing.
 *
 * Reads happen at build time, not in the browser. That is the read/write split in CLAUDE.md
 * doing its job: a traffic spike never touches the egress quota, and the site keeps serving
 * if the database is paused — which on the free tier it will be, after about a week of
 * quiet. It also means every report is a real page with a real URL, which matters for a
 * corpus meant to be cited.
 *
 * Writes stay in the browser, because they are the only thing that genuinely cannot be
 * static: submitting a report, and reporting whether one still works. The one read a
 * browser makes is the freshness overlay in src/lib/fresh.ts, which never renders a page,
 * only adds to one.
