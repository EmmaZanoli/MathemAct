 * The derived values the listing filters on, computed in one place.

 * version 2 filters are not columns — recency, time-spent band, "has prompts", "has code or
 * formalisation" — so something has to derive them, and that something is called from two
 * places that must agree: `ReportCard.astro` during the build, and the freshness overlay in
 * the browser, which builds a card for anything posted since. A card whose bucket was
 * computed differently is a card that fails a filter it should match, and the reader has no
 * way to notice.
 *
 * **This module must not import anything that reaches src/lib/supabase.ts.** It is imported
 * by the listing's client script, and CLAUDE.md's rule is that /reports/ never loads the auth
 * bundle. Only report-schema.ts, which is data.
