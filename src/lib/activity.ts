/**
 * The activity feed: reading somebody's own events, and turning them into sentences.
 *
 * This is a browser-only module, like src/lib/moderation.ts and for the same kind of reason.
 * A feed is made of exactly the rows the static export must never contain — one person's
 * private view of what they did and what happened to them — so it cannot be built at build
 * time, and the page that shows it is under /account/, which already loads the Supabase
 * client. Nothing here is imported from Astro frontmatter and nothing here may be.
 *
 * The database stores events, not messages: a kind, a target, a timestamp, sometimes an
 * actor. Every word a person reads is composed here, in `describe()`. That is the whole
 * reason this feature is not the "message table" rejected on 2026-08-16 — there is no prose
 * sitting in a row going stale, and rewording a notification is a change to this file rather
 * than a migration over history.
 *
 * Three things `describe()` is careful about, all inherited from the schema:
 *
 *   * **A moderation outcome never names the moderator.** The row carries no actor for one,
 *     so the sentence cannot accidentally acquire a name later.
 *   * **A moderation outcome never carries the reason either.** This table holds events; the
 *     sentence a moderator wrote is in public.moderation_notices, addressed to the person it
 *     is about, and src/lib/notices.ts reads it. A feed row says that something was decided
 *     and where to read why, which is why several of them now link to /account/#decisions.
 *   * **A rating never names the rater.** public.ratings is readable only by its author,
 *     which is what keeps a debate's aggregate hidden until you have taken a position;
 *     "Somebody rated" is the most that may ever be said.
