/**
 * The data attributes a debate card carries, computed in one place.
 *
 * Same argument as `src/lib/report-facets.ts`, and the same failure it exists to prevent: the
 * listing filters and sorts by reading values off a card's `dataset`, and cards are built
 * twice — by `/debates/index.astro` during the build, and by the freshness overlay in the
 * browser for anything posted since. A card whose attributes were assembled differently is a
 * card that fails a sort it should be in, and the reader has no way to notice.
 *
 * So neither consumer writes an attribute name. Both call `debateCardAttrs()` and hand the
 * result either to Astro's spread or to `applyCardAttrs()`, which means a renamed attribute
 * breaks the build rather than quietly halving a sort.
 *
 * **This module must not import anything that reaches src/lib/supabase.ts.** It is imported by
 * the listing's client script, and CLAUDE.md's rule is that a reading page never loads the auth
 * bundle. It imports nothing at all.

 * exported debate with fewer than ten scored positions. Both are the same fact — *this cannot
 * be ranked yet* — and they are deliberately not distinguished here, because the sort treats
 * them identically and the card renders no distribution either way.
