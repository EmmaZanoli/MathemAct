/**
 * Draft autosave for the submission form.
 *
 * Losing a half-written submission is how we lose a contributor. A well-structured account
 * takes the better part of an hour to write, the audience is senior and busy, and somebody
 * who loses one to a closed tab does not write it again — they conclude the site is not
 * serious and never come back. That is the entire justification for this file.
 *
 * Keyed per user, because a shared machine is a real thing in a mathematics department and
 * one person's draft appearing in another person's form would be both alarming and a
 * disclosure. The key includes the account id, so signing out and in as somebody else
 * cannot surface it.
 *
 * localStorage rather than the database. A draft is not content: it is not moderated, not
 * exported, not published, and not anybody else's business. Sending every keystroke to
 * Postgres would also put a rate limit and an egress quota in the path of typing.
 *
 * Everything here is defensive about storage failing. It is blocked outright under some
 * cookie policies and in private browsing, and a draft that cannot be saved must degrade to
 * a form that still works rather than an error nobody can act on.
