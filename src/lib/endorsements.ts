/**
 * Endorsing a contribution, which is not voting for it.
 *
 * Two actions, mutually exclusive, both reversible: "this also captures my view", and "I agree
 * with the position, but not this reason". The second exists because without it the first has to
 * carry both meanings and a reader cannot tell a widely-held reason from a widely-shared
 * conclusion.
 *
 * **This module can read your own endorsements and nobody else's, and that is a property of the
 * database rather than a choice made here.** `comment_endorsements_select_own` returns one
 * person's rows: their own. Endorsing requires holding a rating, ratings are readable only by
 * their author, so a list of endorsers would publish the private position of everybody on it by
 * inference — "this captures my view" on a contribution written from 8 places its endorser near
 * 8. There is deliberately no function here that takes a comment id and returns people, and
 * adding one would not work if it were written.
 *
 * **Counts are not here either.** They come from the nightly export, like every other number on
 * this site, because a browser cannot count rows it cannot read. A reader's own action shows
 * immediately and optimistically; the total settles overnight.
