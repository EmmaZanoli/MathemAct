/**
 * The citation graph: which reports and debates point at which others.
 *
 * This is the module that makes the two halves of the site one thing. Everything else here
 * treats a report and a debate as separate kinds of document; this treats them as
 * nodes, and resolves either into the same display shape — a title, a URL, and optionally
 * the exact comment that carried the quotation.
 *
 * Read at build time like the rest of the corpus, and resolved against it: a citation row
 * knows only a kind and an id, so the title comes from src/lib/reports.ts or
 * src/lib/debates.ts. A citation whose endpoint is not in the corpus — hidden since,
 * or never published — resolves to nothing and is dropped rather than rendered as a broken
 * link. Row level security already refuses those rows to the anonymous key the build uses;
 * dropping them here is the second lock, for the day the site builds from a JSON export
 * somebody assembled by hand.
