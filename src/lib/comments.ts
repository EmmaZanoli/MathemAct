/**
 * Discussion: reading a thread at build time, and the four things a browser does to one.
 *
 * Same shape as src/lib/reports.ts — `readComments()` is the single swap point, reads
 * happen during the build, writes happen in a browser — with one consequence that is worth
 * stating plainly because it shows on screen.
 *
 * **Markdown and TeX are rendered at build time and nowhere else.** A comment that was in
 * the corpus when the site was built arrives as sanitised HTML with its formulas already
 * set. A comment posted since then is fetched by the browser and shown as the plain text it
 * was written as, marked as such. The alternative is shipping a markdown parser and a copy
 * of KaTeX to every reader, and doing the sanitising in the place an attacker controls.
 * Neither is worth an hour's less latency on the rendering of one remark.
 *
 * So: this module returns *source text*. It never returns HTML, and nothing here should
 * ever start doing so. CommentThread.astro is where source becomes markup, through
 * src/lib/markdown.ts, at build time.
